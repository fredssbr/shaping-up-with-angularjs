Angular JS

    A client-side JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to HTML.

Directives

    A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.
    (bind the behaviour to the screen)

Modules

    Where we write pieces of our Angular Application. It makes our application more maintainable, readable, testable.
    Where we also define dependencies for our apps.

Expressions
    
    Allow you to insert dynamic values into your HTML

Controllers
    
    Controllers are where we define our app's behaviour by defining functions and values
    
Filters
    
    Allows us to format data in an expression
    {{data | filter:options}}

NG-SRC:
    
    The code bellow would not work because the browser tries to load the image before the expression evaluates
    <img src="{{product.images[0].url}}"> 
    In order to avoid that, use a ng-src directive instead.
