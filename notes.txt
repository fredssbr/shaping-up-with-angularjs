Angular JS

    A client-side JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to HTML.

Directives

    A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.
    (bind the behaviour to the screen)

Modules

    Where we write pieces of our Angular Application. It makes our application more maintainable, readable, testable.
    Where we also define dependencies for our apps.

Expressions
    
    Allow you to insert dynamic values into your HTML

Controllers
    
    Controllers are where we define our app's behaviour by defining functions and values
    
Filters
    
    Allows us to format data in an expression
    {{data | filter:options}}

NG-SRC:
    
    The code bellow would not work because the browser tries to load the image before the expression evaluates
    <img src="{{product.images[0].url}}"> 
    In order to avoid that, use a ng-src directive instead.

DIRECTIVES:
    
    In order to avoid repetition of code, we usually want to include a different piece of file that could be used in more than one place.
    For that, ng-include comes in handy. ng-include="'product-title.html'" < the name of the parameter is in between '' because ng-include expects a string variable to be passed in.
    
    In short, directives allow you to write HTML that expresses the behaviour of your web application.
    Template-expanding directives are the simplest: define a custom tag that is expanded or replaced an can contain Controller logic.
    
    TIP: Use element directives for UI widgets and attribute directives for mixin behaviors, like a tooltip.
